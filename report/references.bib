abstract="We present OpenML, a novel open science platform that provides easy access to machine learning data, software and results to encourage further study and application. It organizes all submitted results online so they can be easily found and reused, and features a web API which is being integrated in popular machine learning tools such as Weka, KNIME, RapidMiner and R packages, so that experiments can be shared easily.",
